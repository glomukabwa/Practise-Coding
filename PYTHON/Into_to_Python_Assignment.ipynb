    "1. Register a new student with a unique ID, name, and email.\n",
    "2. Add available courses (e.g., Python, Data Science, Web Development).\n",
    "3. Allow students to enroll in one or more courses.\n",

    "5. Allow updating a student's email.\n",
    "6. Allow removing a student or a course.\n",
    "7. Use functions for each operation.\n",
    "8. Use dictionaries to store student data and lists for courses.\n",
    "9. Use loops to allow multiple operations until the user chooses to exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Use input functions to interact with the user.\n",
    "- Use dictionaries and lists to manage data.\n",
    "- Use functions to organize your code.\n",
    "- Use loops and conditionals to control the flow.\n",
    "- Ensure the program handles invalid input gracefully.\n",
